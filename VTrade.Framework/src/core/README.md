# Core Framework Components

This directory contains the core components of the VTrade Framework. These components form the foundation of the trading system and include:

## Components
- Base classes for trading strategies
- Core market data handling
- Order management system
- Position tracking
- Event system
- Framework configuration

## Usage
Core components should be designed to be extensible and reusable across different trading strategies. When adding new core functionality:
1. Ensure it's truly a core component needed by multiple parts of the system
2. Document public APIs thoroughly
3. Include unit tests
4. Follow SOLID principles
