             INSTALLING FINBERT FOR GRANDE TRADING SYSTEM
================================================================================

QUICK INSTALL:
--------------
1. Right-click "install_finbert.ps1" 
2. Select "Run with PowerShell"
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for installation
4. Restart MT5 terminal and EA

OR

1. Double-click "install_finbert.bat"
2. Wait 5-10 minutes for installation
3. Restart MT5 terminal and EA

WHAT GETS INSTALLED:
--------------------
- PyTorch (Deep Learning Framework)
- Transformers (HuggingFace Library for FinBERT)
- NumPy (Numerical Computing)
- FinBERT Model (~440MB download)

TOTAL SIZE: ~1GB

CHECKING IF IT WORKS:
---------------------
After installation, look in your MT5 Experts log for:

SUCCESS - Real FinBERT Active:
  [OK] FinBERT dependencies loaded successfully
  [OK] Enhanced FinBERT pipeline initialized successfully
  [OK] FinBERT AI: Real financial sentiment analysis active

FAILURE - Using Fallback:
  [ERROR][ERROR][ERROR] FINBERT NOT AVAILABLE [ERROR][ERROR][ERROR]
  [WARNING] FALLING BACK TO KEYWORD-BASED ANALYSIS (NOT REAL AI)
  [WARNING] Calendar analysis is using KEYWORD MATCHING

MANUAL INSTALLATION:
--------------------
Open Command Prompt and run:

  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  python -m pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
  python -m pip install transformers
  python -m pip install numpy

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------

Problem: Python not found
Solution: Install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
          Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
          Restart computer after installing

Problem: Installation takes too long
Solution: This is normal. First install downloads ~500MB of files.
          FinBERT model is downloaded on first use (~440MB more).

Problem: Firewall blocking
Solution: Temporarily disable firewall during installation
          Re-enable after installation completes

Problem: Still shows fallback mode after install
Solution: 1. Restart MT5 terminal completely
          2. Restart the EA
          3. Check Python packages: python -m pip list
          4. Look for torch, transformers, numpy in the list

TEST MANUALLY:
--------------
To test if FinBERT works, run this in Command Prompt:

  cd C:\git\AutoTrade\VTrade.Framework\applications\mql5\Experts\Grande\mcp\analyze_sentiment_server
  python enhanced_finbert_analyzer.py

Look for:
  [OK] Enhanced FinBERT dependencies loaded successfully
  [OK] Loading Enhanced FinBERT model: yiyanghkust/finbert-tone
  [OK] Enhanced FinBERT pipeline initialized successfully

If you see:
  [ERROR][ERROR][ERROR] FINBERT NOT AVAILABLE

Then the Python packages are not installed correctly.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
--------------------
- Windows 10 or later
- Python 3.8 or later
- 1GB free disk space
- Internet connection (for initial download)
- 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)

WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE:
----------------------
FALLBACK MODE (keyword matching):
  - Counts words like "bullish" and "bearish"
  - No AI or deep learning
  - Fast but unreliable
  - Cannot understand context

REAL FINBERT AI:
  - Deep learning transformer model
  - Trained on financial texts
  - Understands context and nuance
  - Much more accurate
  - Research-backed confidence scoring

NEED HELP?
----------
1. Check MT5 Experts log for emoji indicators
2. Run Python scripts manually to see errors
3. Verify Python is installed: python --version
4. Check pip works: python -m pip --version
5. List installed packages: python -m pip list
