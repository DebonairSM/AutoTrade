# Grande Trading System - Trade Transparency Guide

## Overview

The Grande trading system now includes comprehensive trade decision logging with **noise-free operation**. You'll see exactly why each trade was executed or rejected, without initialization clutter or useless status messages.

## Logging Levels

### 1. **Normal Operation** (Default)
- **Trade decisions and execution results** (what you want to see)
- **Regime changes** (actionable market context)
- **Position closing results**
- **ERROR messages** (critical failures)
- **WARNING messages** (dangerous settings)

### 2. **Detailed Trade Logging** (`InpLogDetailedInfo = true`)
- Everything from Normal Operation, plus:
- **Complete signal analysis** for each trade attempt
- **Risk calculation breakdowns** 
- **Signal criteria pass/fail status**
- **Market context details**

### 3. **Debug Mode** (`InpLogDebugInfo = true`)
- Everything from above, plus:
- **Initialization messages** 
- **Component startup confirmations**
- **Visual testing messages**
- **Chart object management**

## How to Configure Logging

```
InpLogDetailedInfo = false    // Clean, essential trade info only
InpLogDebugInfo = false       // No initialization noise
```

### For Learning/Analysis
```
InpLogDetailedInfo = true     // See complete trade reasoning
InpLogDebugInfo = false       // Still no initialization noise
```

### For Troubleshooting Only
```
InpLogDetailedInfo = true     // Full trade analysis
InpLogDebugInfo = true        // Include system diagnostics
```
