## üìä Report Structure

### Hourly Report Components

```

Report Time: 2025.01.17 14:00:00
Session Duration: 03:45:30
Symbol: EURUSD | Account Equity: 10000.00

--- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ---
Total Signals Evaluated: 45
Signals Executed: 2 (4.4%)
Signals Rejected: 43 (95.6%)

--- SIGNAL TYPE BREAKDOWN ---
Trend Signals: 28
Breakout Signals: 12
Range Signals: 5
Triangle Signals: 0

--- REJECTION ANALYSIS ---
EMA Alignment Failed: 15 (34.9%)
Pullback Too Far: 12 (27.9%)
RSI Conditions Failed: 8 (18.6%)
Insufficient Volume: 5 (11.6%)
Risk Management Block: 3 (7.0%)

--- MARKET CONDITIONS ---
Current Price: 1.08450
Current Regime: TREND_BULL (Confidence: 0.75)
ADX Values - H1: 32.5 | H4: 28.3 | D1: 24.7
RSI Values - Current: 58.2 | H4: 62.5 | D1: 55.3
ATR: 0.00082
Key Levels Detected: 5
Nearest Resistance: 1.08520 (7.0 pips away)
Nearest Support: 1.08380 (7.0 pips away)

--- OPPORTUNITY ANALYSIS ---
üî¥ HIGH REJECTION RATE: System is being too conservative.
   Primary Issue: EMA alignment criteria too strict.

--- ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS ---
1. EMA ALIGNMENT: Consider reducing timeframe alignment requirements
   or waiting for clearer trend establishment.

2. PULLBACK DISTANCE: Price frequently too far from EMAs.
   Consider: a) Increasing acceptable pullback range
            b) Using limit orders at optimal levels
```

## üîç Rejection Tracking

The system tracks these specific rejection reasons:

### Signal Validation Rejections
- **EMA Alignment**: H1 and H4 EMAs not properly aligned
- **Pullback Distance**: Price too far from EMA20 (>1√óATR)
- **RSI Conditions**: RSI not in 40-60 range or wrong direction
- **Volume Requirements**: Insufficient volume for breakouts
- **Pattern Issues**: No valid inside bar, NR7, or ATR expansion

### Risk Management Rejections
- **Drawdown Limit**: Account drawdown exceeds threshold
- **Max Positions**: Maximum concurrent positions reached
- **Position Already Open**: Symbol/magic combination active
- **Invalid Lot Size**: Calculated lot size invalid

### Market Condition Rejections
- **Key Levels**: No strong key levels detected
- **Range Too Narrow**: Range width insufficient for trading
- **Market Trending**: ADX too high for range trading
- **Trend Follower Block**: Multi-timeframe analysis rejection

## üìà Data Collection Points

Each decision records:
- **Timestamp**: Exact time of evaluation
- **Signal Type**: TREND_BULL, TREND_BEAR, BREAKOUT, RANGE, TRIANGLE
- **Decision**: PASSED, REJECTED, BLOCKED, EXECUTED, FAILED
- **Rejection Reason**: Specific detailed reason if rejected
- **Market Data**: Price, ATR, ADX (H1/H4/D1), RSI (Current/H4/D1)
- **Regime**: Current market regime and confidence
- **Key Levels**: Count and nearest support/resistance
- **Volume**: Volume ratio for breakouts
- **Risk Metrics**: Risk percent, calculated lot size
- **Account State**: Equity, open positions

## ü§ñ FinBERT Integration

The system generates AI-ready data in two formats:

### 1. CSV Export (FinBERT_Data_SYMBOL_DATE.csv)
```csv
timestamp,signal_type,decision,rejection_reason,price,atr,adx_h1,adx_h4,adx_d1,regime,regime_confidence,rsi_current,rsi_h4,rsi_d1,volume_ratio,risk_percent,account_equity,open_positions,calendar_signal,calendar_confidence
2025-01-17 14:00:00,TREND_BULL,REJECTED,EMA alignment failed,1.08450,0.00082,32.5,28.3,24.7,TREND_BULL,0.75,58.2,62.5,55.3,1.5,2.5,10000.00,0,NEUTRAL,0.45
```

### 2. FinBERT Analysis Prompt
The system generates structured prompts for AI analysis:

```
MARKET ANALYSIS REQUEST FOR AI:

CONTEXT: Trading system evaluating EURUSD opportunities.
- Signals analyzed: 45
- Execution rate: 4.4%
- Current regime: TREND_BULL
- Trend strength (ADX): 32.5
- Momentum (RSI): 58.2

KEY BLOCKING FACTORS:
- EMA Alignment: 15 occurrences
- Pullback Distance: 12 occurrences

QUESTION: Should trading criteria be adjusted or maintain current discipline?
Consider: Market conditions, risk/reward, and signal quality.
```

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. Enable Reporting
The system is automatically enabled when the EA starts. Reports are generated hourly and saved to:
```
Files\GrandeReport_SYMBOL_YYYYMMDD.txt
```

### 2. View Reports in MT5
Reports appear in the Experts tab every hour with key metrics:
```
üìä HOURLY INTELLIGENCE REPORT
Time: 2025.01.17 14:00:00
Symbol: EURUSD
--- PERFORMANCE SUMMARY ---
Signals Evaluated: 45
Executed: 2 (4.4%)
Rejected: 43 (95.6%)
--- TOP REJECTION REASONS ---
EMA Alignment: 15
Pullback Distance: 12
RSI Conditions: 8
```

### 3. Export for AI Analysis
FinBERT datasets are automatically generated hourly:
```
Files\FinBERT_Data_EURUSD_20250117.csv
```

### 4. Analyze Patterns
Use the reports to identify:
- **Overly Conservative Settings**: High rejection rates
- **Market Misalignment**: Signals attempted in wrong regimes
- **Technical Issues**: Consistent failure patterns
- **Optimization Opportunities**: Parameters needing adjustment

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Report Settings
```mql5
// Reporting interval (minutes)
g_reporter.Initialize(_Symbol, 60);  // 60-minute reports

// Enable detailed logging
input bool InpLogDetailedInfo = true;  // See detailed rejection reasons
```

### Data Retention
- **Text Reports**: Saved daily (one file per day)
- **CSV Data**: Saved daily for FinBERT analysis
- **Memory Buffer**: Stores last 1000 decisions

## üéØ Benefits

1. **Complete Transparency**: Know exactly why trades aren't happening
2. **Data-Driven Optimization**: Identify which criteria need adjustment
3. **AI-Ready Data**: Feed decisions to FinBERT for analysis
4. **Performance Tracking**: Monitor signal quality over time
5. **Risk Management**: Verify risk controls are working

## üìù Example Insights

### High Rejection Scenario
```
‚ö†Ô∏è ALERT: No trades executed despite 45 signals evaluated!
Primary blocker: EMA Alignment

RECOMMENDATION: EMA alignment failing 34.9% of signals. 
Consider reducing H4 timeframe requirement during strong H1 trends.
```

### Optimal Trading Scenario
```
‚úÖ TRADING ACTIVE: 5 positions opened.
Success rate: 45.6%
Primary entry: Trend trades during pullbacks
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### No Reports Generated
- Check `g_reporter` initialization in OnInit()
- Verify timer is running (OnTimer function)
- Check file permissions in Files directory

### Missing Data Points
- Ensure all detectors are initialized
- Check InpEnableCalendarAI for calendar data
- Verify g_keyLevelDetector is active

### FinBERT Export Issues
- Check file write permissions
- Verify CSV format compatibility
- Ensure sufficient disk space

## üö¶ Future Enhancements

- [ ] Real-time dashboard visualization
- [ ] WebSocket streaming to analysis server
- [ ] Machine learning pattern recognition
