# Fix for Error 10046: Trading Not Allowed

## Quick Fix Checklist

### 1. Enable AutoTrading in MetaTrader 5

**Check the AutoTrading Button:**
- Look at the toolbar in MT5
- Find the "AutoTrading" button (looks like a play/stop button)
- It should be GREEN (enabled), not RED (disabled)
- Click it to toggle if needed

### 2. Check EA Properties on Chart

**Right-click on the chart where GrandeTradingSystem is running:**
1. Select "Expert Advisors" → "Properties" (or press F7)
2. Go to the "Common" tab
3. Ensure these are CHECKED:
   - ✅ "Allow live trading"
   - ✅ "Allow DLL imports" (if needed)
   - ✅ "Allow WebRequest for listed URL" (if using web features)
4. Click OK

### 3. Check Symbol Trading Permissions

**In MT5 Market Watch:**
1. Right-click on EURUSD! 
2. Select "Specification"
3. Check that:
   - Trading is allowed for the symbol
   - Expert Advisors are permitted
   - Market hours are open

### 4. Check Account Type

**Verify your account settings:**
- Go to Tools → Options → Expert Advisors tab
- Ensure "Allow automated trading" is checked
- Check "Allow DLL imports" if needed
- Verify your account allows EA trading (some demo/contest accounts don't)

### 5. Terminal Global Settings

**Tools → Options → Expert Advisors:**
- ✅ Allow automated trading
- ✅ Disable automated trading when the account has been changed
- ✅ Disable automated trading when the profile has been changed
- ✅ Allow DLL imports
- ✅ Allow WebRequest for listed URL (if needed)

### 6. For EURUSD! (Futures Symbol)

If you're trading EURUSD! (futures):
- Ensure your broker supports automated trading on futures
- Check if you need special permissions for futures trading
- Verify market hours (futures have different hours than spot forex)

## Alternative: Try Spot EURUSD

If the futures symbol continues to have issues, try:
1. Remove the EA from EURUSD! chart
2. Open a regular EURUSD (spot forex) chart
3. Drag the EA onto the EURUSD chart
4. Enable the same settings

## Verification Steps

After making these changes:
1. Remove the EA from the chart
2. Re-attach it to the chart
3. Ensure all permissions are granted in the popup dialog
4. Watch for trade execution

## Success Indicators

When properly configured, you should see:
- "AutoTrading" button is GREEN
- Log shows: "Trade operations allowed"
- Trades execute without error 10046
- Successful order placement messages

## If Still Not Working

1. **Check with your broker**: Some brokers require EA verification
2. **Try a different symbol**: Test with major pairs like EURUSD (spot)
3. **Check account balance**: Ensure sufficient margin
4. **Verify server connection**: Green status in bottom right corner
5. **Contact broker support**: They may need to enable algo trading on your account

## The Good News

Your EA logic is working correctly! The system is:
- ✅ Evaluating signals properly (scoring system working)
- ✅ Passing the relaxed TrendFollower checks
- ✅ Attempting to place trades with proper SL/TP
- ✅ Calculating position sizes correctly

Once you fix the permissions, trades should execute successfully!
